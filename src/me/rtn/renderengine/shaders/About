To avoid confusion the files that are not a class or similar are GLSL files, they're used to help load textures,
lighting and other stuff. IntelliJ does not support code to be written in the GLSL format, so its being read out
of a text document and programmed within that text document. Yes not the most efficient way of doing it but it works for
the overall outcome of what we need them to do.

If you want to add your own shaders, textures or lighting, I don't suggest copying it and replacing
it with your own values, as for different values it will require different methods, and if I'm correct as GLSL gets updated
the way they are written in code is changed as well. If you want to learn about GLSL visit this site
