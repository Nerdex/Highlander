# Usage
Highlander is made open source for the purpose of learning. The game is currently an ongoing project which I'm working on for college and in my spare time. I don't really expect it to go far anywhere nor am i trying to. I made the project to help people learn about openGL and lwjgl. I admit the code in this project isn't the best. If you want to fork it feel free, or ask me any questions on twitter @RapidTheNerd

# FAQ (sorta) 
1) Can I use this code? A: Yes
2) Can I distribute it? A: If you want to feel free. It is basic lwjgl and openGL with some rendering involved.
3) Why is it licensed if we can use/distribute it? A: I don't really want people taking it line by line and saying "HEY I MADE THIS ALL BY MYSELF" that's literally the worse thing that anyone can do towards developers.
4) Will you follow me on twitter? A: No but you can follow me ;)
5) Do you recomend Java for games? A: HELL NO
6) Is this ideal for new game developers? A: No, personally I suggest starting small on something like pacman or space invaders to get a feel of how game development is done before moving onto bigger projects.
7) Do you provide support for this code? A: Sometimes, it generally depends on the issue. If the issue is something massive I highly suggest that you go out and find a way to fix it yourself, remember that debugging will help you a lot when working on any code project.
